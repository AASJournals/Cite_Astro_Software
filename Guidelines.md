# Guidelines

This document attempts to list the code properties we recommend
authors and referees can check for, to give admitted codes some
uniformity in quality etc.

The intention here is to provide guidelines for Editors and Reviewers and thereby let authors know what is needed in a paper or software package. 

## Major/Main algorithm description


## Test results

## How to get the software

## Basic User Manual examples and where to get full docs

## Discussion/analysis of decisions made: why did the authors do X? what can others learn from the experience of developing X?


## More Advanced?

Could there be advanced properties of code submission that are nice to have, but we absolutely don't care about?

### Code coverage

Even if we would recommend it, what fraction of code should be covered. 80% ? 90% ? Should only the regression tests cover 100% of the code?
